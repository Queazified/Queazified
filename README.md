Hey there, my name is Andrey, also known as Queazified - a person who runs their own Home Lab and enjoys trying out and fixing new technology.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my littlelink repo, which is like Linktree, a link that shows you all my social media, and other things, like my Spotify account, but is open source, unlike Linktree.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Proxmox, a hypervisor that I now use, and TrueNAS, my new way to store files on my server.
- âš¡ Server specs: HP EliteDesk 800 G3 SFF with a CPU of Intel Core i5-7500 and a GPU as the GT710 (2GB VRAM version), I would say this is not too beefy, but not too weak.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me via email! Send me an email at andrey@queazified.co.uk and I'll try and get back to you as soon as I can!
